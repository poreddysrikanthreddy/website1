                  B2B software company whose product had hundreds of
                  integrations. We built Prismatic for one reason: to give B2B

                  customers. Our team has worked in SaaS industries like
                  healthcare, agriculture, and fintech. We know how complex
                  integrations can get in the real world, and we built Prismatic
                  to help you handle any integration that comes your way.
