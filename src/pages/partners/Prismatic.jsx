          Prismatic refers to the quality of breaking light into its component
          colors, creating a spectrum. In optics, prismatic effects occur when
          light interacts with transparent or translucent materials, such as a
          prism. The phenomenon is characterized by the dispersion of light into
          its various wavelengths, resulting in a vibrant display of colors.
          Beyond optics, "prismatic" can also describe diversity or variety in a
          broader context, representing a range of perspectives or elements.
          Whether applied to physics or metaphorically, prismatic conveys the
          idea of a multifaceted, colorful, and diverse experience or
          phenomenon.

                  Prismatic was born out of our foundersâ€™ experience scaling a
                  B2B software company whose product had hundreds of
                  integrations. We built Prismatic for one reason: to give B2B
                  software teams an easier way to provide integrations to their
                  customers. Our team has worked in SaaS industries like
                  healthcare, agriculture, and fintech. We know how complex
                  integrations can get in the real world, and we built Prismatic
                  to help you handle any integration that comes your way.

                  Within your organization you can assemble an integration by
                  tying together multiple component's actions. That integration
                  can be tested using our integration designer. Once you are
                  satisfied with your integration, it can be published, and
                  instances of the integration can be configured and deployed to
                  one or many of your customers.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-8">
                  Instances deployed to customers can be configured using
                  customer-specific config variables, so one integration can be
                  uniquely deployed to multiple customers with different setups.
